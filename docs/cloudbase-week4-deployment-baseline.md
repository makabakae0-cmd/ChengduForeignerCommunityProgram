map manual verification:
- marker loading: pass
- marker selection: pass
- detail jump: pass
- detail navigation: pass
- tool/device: WeChat DevTools simulator, iPhone 15 Pro Max
- WeChat DevTools version: Stable 2.01.2510280
- notes: Project imports and opens `/pages/places/map`; marker loading and marker selection were verified. Detail jump enters `/pages/places/detail?id=<place-id>`. Detail navigation triggers the WeChat native location/map flow and shows the target place; the external `qqmap://` routeplan URL cannot be fully opened in the desktop simulator, which is accepted as a simulator limitation for Week 4.

code integration:
- Mini Program manifest AppID: configured in apps/mobile/src/manifest.json
- Mini Program CloudBase init env: cloud1-d7gxdk8t43bd639c0 when VITE_API_MODE=cloudbase-function
- mobile API modes: mock / http / cloudbase-function
- cloudbase-function target: community-map-api
- CloudBase provider live mode: available for places when CLOUDBASE_PROVIDER_MODE=live and CLOUDBASE_ENV_ID or TCB_ENV is set
- CloudBase provider fallback: mock provider when live mode is not explicitly enabled
```

## Execution Notes

- CloudBase MCP auth status was `READY` and bound to `cloud1-d7gxdk8t43bd639c0`.
- HTTP access service was already enabled; no `/api` or `/api/*` route was created because `community-map-api` is still an Event placeholder function.
- Static hosting was already enabled and online; no Admin build artifact was uploaded.
- Cloud storage was reachable and empty at the root; path rules were recorded only because no real files should be uploaded in this phase.
- Production CloudBase resources were not created or modified.
- `apps/api/src/providers/cloudbase/index.ts` now has a live `places` provider path for CloudBase NoSQL, while events/discover/files/notifications still use the mock fallback until their collections and security rules are ready.
- Production CloudBase environment creation is moved to Week 11 full-chain integration.
- `/api` route creation is moved to Week 8 and remains deferred until `community-map-api` is deployed as the formal HTTP function.
